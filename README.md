<h3>HTML:</h3>
<p>
    <img src="./assets/images/icons/html.png" width="50px" height="50px"><br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a> 
    was used to construct the core of the website.</p>
<h4>Why HTML :</h4>
<p>
    HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for Internet browsers. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements.
</p><hr>

<h3>CSS:</h3>
<p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank">CSS</a>
    was used to style the website after the core was made.</p>
<h4>Why CSS :</h4>
<p>
    CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is responsible for font color and more.
</p><hr>

<h3>JavaScript:</h3>
<p>
    <img src="./assets/images/icons/javascript-icon.png" width="50px" height="50px"><br>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
    was used to style the website after the core was made.</p>
<h4>Why Javascript :</h4>
<p>
    Its developers define it as a “scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex things on web pages.” JavaScript makes web pages more dynamic and user-friendly so that they respond to visitors' actions. Or, to put it another way, JavaScript makes web pages interactive.

<h2>Lighthouse:</h2>
<h3>And why It's important to run before deployment</h3>
<p><strong>Performance : </strong>
    refers to the speed in which web pages are downloaded and displayed on the user's web browser. Website performance optimization, or website optimization is the field of knowledge about increasing web performance
</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility : </strong>
    means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the website.
</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices : </strong>
    are related to how to carry out a task or configure something. Strict best practice guidelines may be set by a governing body or may be internal to an organization.
</p>
<p><strong>SEO : </strong> 
    stands for 'Search Engine Optimization', which is the process of getting traffic from free, organic, editorial, or natural search results in search engines. It aims to improve your website's position in search results pages. Remember, the higher the website is listed, the more people will see it.
